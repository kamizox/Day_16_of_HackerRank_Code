✅ Day 16 of #30 DaysOfCode – String to Integer Conversion in Java!
Today, I tackled an interesting problem:
"Convert a String to an Integer in Java, and handle errors gracefully."

🔍 What I practiced:

Reading input using BufferedReader

Converting a string to integer using Integer.parseInt()

Handling invalid input using try-catch block

Printing "Bad String" if the input isn't a valid integer

🧠 Lesson learned:
Always expect user input to fail. Wrapping parsing logic inside a try-catch block is a clean and professional way to handle errors in real-world applications.
